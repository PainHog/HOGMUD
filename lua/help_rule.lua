It is against the rules of this mud to advertise another mud either on
public channels (say, chat, ask, answer, shout, yell, music, quest, avatar,
newbiechat, any guild, order, clan or council channel, wartalk or racetalk),
through your title, description, or biography or via leaving a note on any
public, guild, order, clan or council board in the Realms.  If you are
asked to desist and do not do so immediately, your privileges on this mud
may be restricted or terminated.

Bots, the running of a character using triggers while there is no one
attending it, is not permitted. If you are caught botting be aware that
bad things may happen to your character and you may lose any number of
things from your character.

Be aware, that if you are just sitting there, and using triggers to keep
yourself online, you may be moved to Kallista, forced to save, and then
forced to quit.  If you are going to play, then play.  Staying online
all day as a mana-producing "battery" for your Deity is not how its
done...

It's best to logon when you want to play, and logoff when you can't any
longer.  Then logon again when you get more time to play.  Thanks.

10) Players will do what Immortals ask.  Immortals will not abuse this.
If an Immortal asks you to do something, unless its completely outrageous,
please assume there is a good reason behind it.  If you feel you have been
abused by this rule, contact the active Implementors.

11) Players that continually break rules will be banned.  We are not
afraid of using the "ban" command.

suitable punishment for those who can't seem to follow the rules.

12) When all else fails, see the active Implementors.

13) Levels 54 and under are newbie helpers.  It is their job to aid

also use the setfol command but ONLY for their own following.  Any
misuse of either of these commands will be highly punished.
