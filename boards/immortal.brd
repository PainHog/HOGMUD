ok...do an "finfo (followingname)" for your following... (;

That little '' after your name, is the Motto...you can use setfol to
set that...just a little blurb that fits your following...

The description lets you put more information there, so when people
finfo you to see what you're about, they know whats up.  I just slapped
in that generic "soandso and theyre worshippers are whatever" thing, so
it was in there (;  if you setfol name desc blahblahblah, it will overwrite
that stuff (;

oh...and this is my stupid pet peeve (;  when you make leaders or guardians,
make sure you capitalize their names (;  thanks (;

Note that HELP IMMLAWS has changed to reflect the "no corpse retrievals"
rule (;  If any bitches, just make em read the Immlaws (;

Oh!  If you didn't already know, Demi's, I added that generic chest to the
"make" command, so you can just "make chest" to pop em out.  These are the ones
that people can't take out of the pit rooms, and don't get all heavy when they
are full.

Spells such as Bless, Eldritch sphere, anti magic shell, etc...that have more than one part to them
(for example, bless shows as Bless for 999rds -10svs Bless for 999rds 10hr)
can be dispelled in PARTS. The code does not see it as one spell, but rather two distinct parts.
these parts are dispelled, and count as 2 different spells in terms of dispel magic.
Therefore, it is possible and is NOT a bug that you can lose the svs from a bless but retain the HR.
This also works with skills like monk's Master which adds a ton of effects, this effects are individually
dispelled when hit by dispel magic, (nameless had this happen a lot fighting mage mobs.)

So in short, it is not a bug, but the way the code works.  The easiest way to tell is by looking
at score, if the same spell has two or more different parts showing up in score, then those parts
are targetted by dispel magic, not the entire spell that caused those effects.

Hope this helps.

Just thought I would post this to help out the rest of you FLI's if
you wanted it.  The following is a trigger for letting your people
know how much mana you have left on ftell.  It's actually done as
two different trigger.
     
Part One:
%1 ftells 'mana'
ftell @mana
     
Part Two:
^-<(%d)hp (%d)ma (%d)mv  -$(%d) (%d)tnl>*
#var mana %2
     
     
Hope this helps!  I love it.

K, if you want to, you all have access to the "clones" command.
It's just like the old "users" command, except it shows multiple
connections from one IP address in the same section, making it
easier to spot multiplayers.  Remember that quite a few people
connect from a common gateway, however, so just because more than
one person is using the same IP address, doesn't mean they are
breaking the rules.  This just helps see who might be pushing
the rules (;

Had an idea or an old one actually. What are the chances we could get
following towns? My idea was like a 10 room mini zone starting with
existing temples. Then followers could use money/glory to add more rooms 
oror maybe even mobs to it. Would give people something to do with there
loot. Maybe we could start writing some history for the followings help
build up the rp aspect of the place. Another idea to go with this would
bbe like a following glory bank similar to the fdeposit with the money.
Not sure if this is feasable but just some ideas i had. I'm sure the table
is loaded with other stuff you guys's are implementing right now.
Just curious to see what others think of this idea.

I think this kicks ass...and it falls into place perfectly with wanting
to dedicate each continent to each of the different alignments...

So the evil towns would be on the Bazabel continent, goods on the dville
continent, neutrals on the wolfen continent (we need continent names (; ).

Anyone mind working up a table of buildings/mobs/rooms for towns?  You
can use the Temple room costs as a baseline...We'll want to make things
a little more costly for town buildings I think, but I think this idea
rocks (;

I think an easy way to start would maybe be setting up a land deed
type thing. Say a basic 10 room deed. I'm not good with numbers but say
like 1mil a room. I still think working glory into it would be nice sides
just money. Combat dummies are 200k according to the list.. maybe some guard
types. Move the existing temples to them and work with what is left over.
I think the idea of the alignment based continents is a good idea. Maybe make
it hard to get to the different ones. Portal an all the different astral walk
type things always made things a lil too slambang i thought. 
One potential problem i see though is mostly everyone is evil. Other continents
might be kinda sparse. Not sure if your leaning towards more of a racial balance
too..kinda sounds like it. Sounds like it would be something interesting to work on.
I'm curious to see how it comes out.

If you "mstat" a player now, it should show their "worn armor" score.
This is the total of just the plain old AC on their armor worn, without
any spells, affects or dexterity coming into play.  It's used to calculate
the armor absorption figures in combat now.  Just FYI (:

"Bodybag" works ok, just gotta put a "yes" at the end to confirm you
want to collect the corpse...such as:

bodybag drazuk yes

Otherwise it just shows you the location of the corpse.  One other nice
thing about bodybag, is it stops the rot timer on the corpse, so you can
hang on to it for a while.

Quick question on sharpen.. it no longer changes avg damage of weapon?
Sharpen only puts 5dr on the weapon now. Before i thought it changed the
avg damage by 5 or so.. been awhile. Enchant give 5dr/hr.. much better
then sharpen alone. I think kinda defeats the purpose of sharpen. People
would rather use the enchant being how it gives hr/dr stead of just the dr.
Just thought id doublecheck on that...

yeah, it just adds the +5dam now...and while you can't sharpen and
enchant an item, you can sharpen an item flagged as magical, but you
can't enchant em (:  So its nice for sharpening any magical swords
they find out there...
