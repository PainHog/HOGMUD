or use two-handed weapons. However, Archmagi have no equal when it comes to
pure spell power.

their tertiary statistic.

A cleric is a mighty healer and protector of the weak.  Led with a mission
to heal and teach, Clerics have many  varied and sundry healing spells at
their command. While clerics possess some combat spells and magic to affect
one's chances in battle, their main goal is self preservation.  They
accelerate in wisdom and knowledge as they gain in level and experience.

The wisdom of the cleric in the ways of magic and the art of healing, make
them a desirable asset for any group.

Wisdom is a clerics prime attribute, and constitution their secondary.
Intelligence is their tertiary statistic.

The races of Human, Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, Pixie, Half-elf, Half-orc, Gith,
Sea-elf, Drow, Gnome, Ghoul and Lizardman are allowed to be a clerics.

The conjurer is an odd sort of person, locking themselves in their homes for
days on end, perfecting magical items.  Not very gifted in combat or
having a wide variety of spells at their disposal, their true strength lies in
the fact that they are masters of creating magical things out of the various
components found in the realm.  A conjurer with a healthy supply of components
can do amazing things.  From creating their own temporary weapons and armor to
summoning forth powerful golems, a conjurer is not to be underestimated in the
least.  Because they choose to spend their time studying and experimenting,
they are limited to small weapons and light armor.

Primary stat is int, secondary is wis, tertiary is luck.

The races of Human, Dwarf, Elf, Half-elf, Sea-elf, Gnome and Ghoul are allowed
to be conjurers.

Calling upon the powers of dark and dangerous planes, the diabolist is a
master of summoning and focusing the power of sinister beings.  Not all
diabolists are evil, but one of the perils of working so closely with the
powers of darkness is becoming ensnared by the demons and devils of the
netherrealms.  Not very strong at physical combat, the diabolist starts out
relatively weak, but after time, becomes a powerful force, able to even summon
mighty creatures to do its bidding.

Intelligence is a diabolists prime attribute, with charisma the secondary.
Wisdom is their tertiary stat.

The races of Human, Pixie, Half-elf, Half-orc, Half-troll, Gith, Drow, Ghoul,
Goblin, Wolfen, Minotaur and Lizardman are allowed to be diabolists.

The druid is a lover and protector of the natural land.  Be it the forests
full of centaurs and deer, the streams full of fish, or the bug-infested
swamps, a druid always strives to protect and preserve nature.  Wielding
mighty spells from the gods themselves, druids strive hard at their work.

Strong in wisdom, with a body trained to near perfection by their rugged
lifestyle, a druid has many disciplines upon which to draw.  From powerful
spells of healing which can bring the near dead back to full vigor, to the
ability to mystically create water and food, to the awesome power of nature
which they command in battle via spells able to quake the land and split
the sky, druids demonstrate that mastery of magic is not just a hobby, but
a way of life for them.  Able to face many warriors on almost even footing,
and able to shield themselves nearly as well as some mages, druids are
truly a gifted class.

Wisdom is a druids prime attribute, and strength the second.  Their tertiary
statistic is constitution.

The races of Human, Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, Pixie, Half-elf, Half-ogre,
Half-orc, Half-troll, Sea-elf, Gnome, Ghoul, Wolfen, Minotaur and Lizardman
are allowed to be druids.
