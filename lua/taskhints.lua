Task system hints
-----------------

Author: Nick Gammon
Date:   6th July 2007

This is called in various places to give a once-off hint to the player. Once 
the hint is given a flag is set, so they don't get the same hint again.

Greetings, $n. I am a task-giver (or should that be task-master?). 
When you looked around you noticed a message about 'tasks available here'.
Completing tasks can earn you gold, experience, items, and glory!
You may consider some tasks too humble for a noble $c such as you. 
However, when you complete (and hand in) a task, that can unlock further 
tasks in a chain. Each one can lead to further rewards, and experience.
To see what you can do with tasks, type '&Ytask&W' to see a list of commands.
You can see a list of available tasks by typing '&Ytask available&W'.
Noble $r, I look forwards to your accepting my task, and having
fun completing it.]]))

Thank you, $n. You have accepted my task. You can now type '&Ytask list&W'

outstanding at once). To remind yourself of the task objectives, 
type '&Ytask show $1&W'. Once all of the objectives are complete (you 
will know because you will see see "(Complete)" next to them), you can hand 
that task in for the task rewards, and possibly further tasks in that chain.]],
