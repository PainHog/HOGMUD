Shane: i did not instigate last night
Shane: i simply said i needed the ankle and he went and killed for it again
Shane: he said he had it in his inv previously
Shane: i never told him to go get it again
Shane: and he looted it and gave it to me..as a present.
Shane: i had in no way the intention of getting it by cheating..i was gonna trade mahkmud for it
Shane: i have been trying for quite some time now
Darwin: well, you'll stay pk for another day or 2. after that i'll probably change you back.

Darwin: You have something to say?
Krom: no
Medea: I hate not knowing how to get this stupid ban to work (gossip)
Medea: I am for real. You are not welcome here. (reply to) Gileriar'derisio.
Medea: I think I got it...please please please say I got it (gossip)
Medea: ARGH (gossip)
Medea: I think I got him (ftell)
Medea: banned for 1000 days (ftell)
Medea: That would be helo who has called me a slut, a whore, a worthless woman, and has attempted to illegally pk out of his range while I was snooping him and told him to stop.  (avtalk)
Medea: On top of all that he's crossed all of his characters and basically has been banned. (avtalk)
Medea: that took me a half hour how to figure out that damn ban command hehe (tell to) Twyla.
Medea: Pretty sure I did he can't log back in. I destroyed all his characters anyway (reply to) Twyla.
Medea: destroyed them all. He has none to play here (ftell)
Medea: Wouldn't have had to if he'd just gone about his day. Wonder if he's like bipolar or something ;-) (reply to) Twyla.
Medea: What I don't understand is why they keep putting up with that crap. That was enough for me. Anywho. How your day was (reply to) Twyla.
Medea: Did you do anything with ben for his birthday? (reply to) Twyla.
Medea: maybe so (ftell)
Medea: I'm so glad (reply to) Twyla.
Medea: whatcha need (reply to) Twyla.
Medea: hah (reply to) Twyla.
Darwin: Explain what you mean.
Aahz: Destroy me. (gossip)
Medea: Grats! (gossip)
Medea: I know you mean well darlin, but we're speaking with him privately so you can continue enjoying the game. I'm sorry it was such a public debacle. (tell to) Celestron.
Medea: 1800 practices?! good lord (immtalk)
Darwin: yeah :( (immtalk)
Darwin: must have done it A LOT! (immtalk)
Medea: Trains....never mind...got it (immtalk)
Aahz: I just feel that the immortals a) do not explain the punishments being handed you. b) are not proactive enough with their time spent on here
Aahz: Also, cheating is RAMPANT on here.
Darwin: That's no excuse for you to join in on the activities
Aahz: You think I haven't cheated A LOT on here? Just like everyone else.
Darwin: a) You read the laws.
Medea: I just showed him where he is to report the bugs and cheating to the immortals
Darwin: Punishments are not written in stone. They are for the immortals to decide what is appropriate per the crime commited.
Aahz: It's all fine an good to tell people to read all that.  But not everyone actually will.
Aahz: If you want to punish someone explain why you are so they know exactly what they did.
Medea: Aahz, why don't you tell us who else has cheated and how then?
Aahz: In the real world judges don't just pull guns and kill people and walk away.
Darwin: Luckily, we're not playing in a real world here.
Aahz: Well, Helo obvoiously
Darwin: I killed you and you still live.
Aahz: Shane does
Darwin: Who have you informed?
Medea: he's banned and not returning. What does Shane do
Medea: hold on... (immtalk)
Aahz: We can still be democratic even though this is make belive.
Aahz: Shane use the pit to swap eq
Medea: This is not a democracy though. I pay for this place to be open. Cahel and Darwin put in a crapload of work for free. This is far from a democracy.
Medea: When.
Darwin: I've already deleted some of shane's characters for doing such things.
Medea: Do you have the log?
Medea: YAY! (immtalk)
Medea: groob? (immtalk)
Medea: anyone else, we're in room 11 if you'd like to be in here. (immtalk)
Aahz: I'm done.  I have better things to do.  I really shouldn't waste my time here like a computer geek...
Aahz: Can I quit please?
Medea: So what do we do now
Medea: Snoop all of shane's characters when he logs in?
Medea: We have a pit for that. (gossip)
Grooble: that's Shane?
Medea: No, that's probably Aahz
Grooble: It is.
Medea: man I hate when they do that crap
Medea: Man. I really hate losing players, but I hate people that cheat like that
Grooble: It wasn't just the one time, either.  He knew what he was doing was wrong and he did it anyway.
Grooble: Grats! (gossip)
Grooble: *snickers* It's okay.  It's the thought that counts. (gossip)
Troy: hehre (gossip)
Jinn: You helled me! (gossip)
Jinn: hehehe (gossip)
Jinn: *grin* (OOC)
Jinn: Heh, I'm back in Hell. (OOC)
Jinn: Apparently Medea didn't unhell me, she just transferred me out. :( (OOC)
