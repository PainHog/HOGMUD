Welcome to The Blade-Knights! This is the first thing you should be reading
as either a new member or as a hopeful. This is the general rules 
that govern this following and shapes how we interact with the world.
*1* Never Harm an Innocent. 
 We are defenders of the peace and guardians of the weak.
An Innocent is defined as ANY player that is Good.
And also any player that has not directly harmed a Good. 
*2* Uphold the ideals of Beauty, Truth, and Justice.
 Each Blade-Knight is expected to adhere to the highest moral caliber.
 This includes unjustified looting/PK, smack talk on public channels,
 or gloating in victory or whining in defeat. 
*3* Word is Bond. 
 Never lie, even to an enemy, speak only the truth.
*4* Live, Fight, and Die as Brethern
 We are a family, and family is key to survival and joy
 Extra EQ, gold, potions, etc...goes to another follower.
 Keep the Rack well stocked with USEFUL eq and potions for all others.
*GOLDEN RULE* HAVE FUN!
 This is game, pure and simple. The whole point is to have fun.
 You are never expected to perform to any measure. Have fun.
 If something is making your expierance worse here, let me know ASAP.
 I'm here for you guys, let me know if you need anything I can provide.

Hello all,
 I wanted to say a few things to you to clear some things up.
 In the RP (roleplay) sense, we are a devoutly holy following.
 We seek to protect what we consider good and to destroy what is evil.
 However, that does not mean anyone wearing an evil aura is "bad"
 Actions speak louder than auras, and that is what we judge all things on.
 Blindly devout is the same as insane, so lets try to play nice. :)
 Also, I do tend to RP a bit, but I DO NOT REQUIRE IT.
 Again, I will never force any of you to RP if you don't want to.
 Its a personal choice that enriches gameplay for some, not all.
 I do have one request: You will place a Rank in your title
 The list of available ranks and their "job" will be listed in another note.
 Do not take these ranks as a specific job. It is for roleplay.
 You are free to do what you want, so don't feel trapped by your choice.
 Lastly, my email is druiz@uci.edu and my AIM SN is Mercutio23
 If you ever need to get ahold of me, or just want to talk, hit me up.
 I want to be a good God for you all, and that means listening and active.
 My online hours are VERY sporadic. If you need to get me for anything
 IM me or email me a time you will be on and I'll try to meet you on.
 Or we can work something out. Either way, don't be a stranger.
 I will also run a lot of small quests for us. 
 The prizes won't be amazing, all the time, but they are for your benefit.
 I want you all to grow as players and again, Have fun.
 Thanks.

ITEM 1
Ancient home of Nyarlathotep,
Dead halls of memories, dust remains to hold
the fate of those that dodged arrows
but never a lack of judgement.
Their backs to wall they had no choice.
 
     ITEM 2
Rose petals are dreams
that form shackles
bounding men
venus fly traps
that hold barbs 
for teeth.
 
 ITEM 3
Increases a warrior's rage in combat,
making blades sharper and muscles stronger.
Yet the price of strength is often a loss of will.
Strength of mind is not to be taken lightly.

Greetings and Salutations, Brethren.
 
I have some affective advice for those who quest alot like me, but have
or are at risk of losing there quest points due to crashes etc
 
Set up a trigger that saves EVERY time you complete a quest. This way you
wont lose any of those hard earned glory!
 
Same with levels or other important events. Set a time trigger so you automatic
ally save every 15 mins! thats all for now :)

Ok Folks, It has become clear that I need to make some tips
and guidelines for the Rack, to keep it clean and useful.
Tip 1: Not all scrolls are useful. No scrolls under level 35 accepted.
Tip 2: Not all wands/staves are useful. None of these under level 40.
The exception is heal staffs, they are good at any level.
Tip 3: Not all potions are useful. None under level 35.
The exception is heal and divinity potions and pills.
Tip 4: All eq is not created equal. No negative (-) affect items
in the pit, except for svs, svp, svb, which is meant to be negative.
Tip 5: All items must have 3 or more points of affects. 
3con, 2str 1dex, etc...The exception is dr, I will take 2's of those.
Tip 6: No items with under 5 total points allowed in Ring, Onbody, and Neck
These are Artifact slots, and therefore I want our rack to reflect that.
Guidelines/Rules
1.) If you see more than 5 of the same item name (Visor of Asps, Etc etec)
 Do not put more in. This just causes clutter.
2.) NEVER should the Shelves leave the Rack room. If one goes missing
or I find it in your inventory, You will make me grumpy.
3.) Do Not EVER take items from our Rack to give to others.
This is stealing, from all of us, and not tolerated.
4.) Be smart when giving or taking from the Rack.
If the shelves become to heavy to lift out, they are stuck there.
Also, lots of bags and items in inventory make for a heavy corpse.
And heavy corpses are hard to rescue.

Hello all,
On the advice of Tabor I have made a change to the Rack.
There are now a separate Shelf for each of you.
This shelf will be used to store a backup set or your own personal items.
Incase of death, you can quickly re-eq yourself
I have two rules for these:
1.) DO NOT HORDE. Awesome gear should be spread around, do not keep all the
best stuff in your Shelf. Spread the wealth.
2.) NEVER TAKE ITEMS FROM SOMEONE ELSES SHELF!!
Doing so will result in bad things. You can only get something out of a shelf
with that person's EXPRESSED permission to me and to yourself.
These are a nice feature, so please use them and don't abuse them.
They are each keyworded to your name, so that will make it easier.
Hope it helps.

It has come to my attention that the innocence of our world is fading.
A gentle soul, Simeon, was struck down by the hand of Riaregnar.
Riaregnar is a soldier of Carnage, he has shown his true way.
My knights and mages, defend our brothers and sisters in Wisdom.
Riaregnar is no longer an innocent, and will be dealt with.
 
This does not apply to any other carnage, only Riaregnar.
If a Carnage assists Riaregnar, they are not at fault.
They are defending their own.
However, if they attack us for retribution then they are also an enemy.
Go forth, wield justice, fear none.

Knights,
 
Here's a pointer to help our following run smoothly. If you are sitting around,
doing nothing productive, but chatting or what not, try organizing the rack.
 
Or do like me, and try to do it a little each time you log in. If we all pitch 
in, it won't be that big of a deal.

I would like to propose that we take the initative and begin attacking

attacking this evil incarnates, trying to suppress there evil influence
from corrupting others. This is ofcourse a mere suggestion, but I offer the floor
to anyone else on the subject
