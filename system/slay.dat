Cmessage	You concentrate deeply, pulling upon all the Powers in the Realm...

A black speck in the sky rapidly turns into a large raven, black as

night.  As it swoops closer, the sky seems to turn to night around you

with the appearance of hundreds of black, squawking birds.


You smirk and point at $N, and the murder of crows surrounds $M, pecking

away at $S eyes, then horribly devouring their flesh!  The birds then fly

away and vanish, leaving a bright white skeleton to collapse slowly, the

only evidence of $N's existence!

~
Vmessage	You feel an awful surge of power as $n's eyes roll back in his head and

small bolts of green lightning crackle about the bottom of $s robes.  Up

in the sky, a small black dot quickly turns into a large black raven, swooping

towards you.  As it approaches, hundreds of crows appears in the skies all

about you, born from the awesome magic summoned by $n.


Before you can react, the crows dart in, pecking at your flesh, your eyes!  The

awful cacophany of cawing was driving you mad, like the scream of a thousand

banshees in your head!  The pain is horrible and just as you are sure it will

never end...it does.

~
Rmessage	You feel the throb of magical energy build up suddenly all around you.

$n's eyes roll back into $s head and small bolts of green lighting crackle

about the bottom of $s robes.  You see $N staring up into the sky, and

following $S gaze upwards, you spy a large raven rapidly approaching.

As the raven nears, the sky fills with hundreds of crows, and they swoop

down at $N!


All you can see of $N is a black mass of cawing crows, ravaging $S body

with their razor-sharp beaks.  A few seconds later, the crows disperse

into the sky.  A bright white skeleton, slowly collapsing, is all that

remains of $N.

Cmessage	You snap your fingers and $N is surrounded by a pillar of light...

Smoke begins to rise from $N. $N screams and bursts into flames.

~
Vmessage	$n snaps his fingers... You are surrounded by a pillar of light.

Your blood begins to boil and you feel your veins tear; what have

you done to deserve such pain? "Fear not, the pain will be gone soon,"

a voice tells you. All that you can see now is darkness...

~
Rmessage	$n brutally slays $N!

$n snaps his fingers. $N is surrounded by a pillar of light and begins

to scream in agony. $N bursts into flames and falls over... dead.

Type		Angel~
Owner		Cahel~
Color		25
Cmessage	You wordlessly slip from the Ether behind $N, offer a silent prayer, and bury two katanas into

their back, piercing their heart and lungs. You smoothly withdraw each blade and mark a small rune of

forgiveness on the cold eyelids of $N.

~
Vmessage	For a moment you remember the days of your early life, the simple choices, the harmless sins.

You smile at the innocence and perhaps the innocence lost. You swear you smell the faint

wisp of jasmine and rose petals. You barely notice the two silver blades that are suddenly 

protruding from your chest. Life ends, silently, respectfully. The last thing you see is the winged

figure of $n.

~
Rmessage	The figure of $n silently appears behind $N and draws two silver blades. $n mouths a

silent prayer before thrusting both blades through the chest of $N. Their body simply goes

limb as their soul is pierced by those two silver blades. $n unceremoniously removes both blades

from the corpse of $N and uses the blooded weapons to carve two runes into the eyes of $N.

#SLAY
Type		Hell~
Owner		Any~
Color		12
Cmessage	You utter the darkest words of the darkest tongue in all creation. The world begins to warp

and the sound of the trees weeping and the earth trembling fills the room. A small tear

appears besides $N, a blast of heat and the smell of sulfur are almost overpowering.

$N looks wide-eyed in fear as tendrils of blood and smoke grab on and pull him

into the Plane of the Ageless.  You hear the sound of flesh being torn and souls

being devoured.  The scream of $N echoes through both realms as they endure suffering

that only the damned feel. A few moments later their mangled corpse falls to pieces

on the floor as the portal to the Nightmare Realm closes.

~
Vmessage	You hear a dark language fill the room, the world grows dark and bends at

the sick will of $n as they speak that cursed language. The world shudders

as a tear in the ether reveals a doorway into the realm of the Nightmare Magnet.

You look in to see a thousand tortures and a thousand reasons to never dream again.

Several long tentacles made of blood, smoke, and teeth wrap themselves around you

and the realization comes to you, this is your fate.  You are pulled into

the Plane of the Ageless and you see the screaming visage of hell itself.

A raven haired boy with razors for teeth slowly peels every inch of skin

for your flesh while a beautiful girl devours your legs and stomach. An angel haired

boy looks at you and smiles as you scream the deepest scream you could ever manage.

Death should have come hours ago, but the pain still burns through your being.

Finally the tear closes and your soul watches from afar as the few pieces left

splater onto the floor.  $n watches your soul float back to the world, watches the scars 

you still carry from that place.

~
Rmessage	The blackest language you have ever heard fills the room, the world itself grows

dark and trembles with fear at the sound of $n 's words.  A tear appears in the

ether next to $N, the smell of sulfur rushes forward carried by a blast of heat.

The sick laughter of some dark being stabs at your soul as tendrils of blood

and smoke reach out and pull $N into the Plane of the Ageless! You hear the

screams of $N as every torture ever imagined and a thousand too depraved to be spoken aloud

are inflicted onto them and their very soul. At last the screaming stops and a few smouldering,

broken, bloody pieces of $N fall to the ground, smoke and pain slowly rising.
