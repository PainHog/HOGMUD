Drow are the darker, more evil cousins of Elves.  They were once part of
the happy community of Elves which roam the forests today, but have long
since moved under the ground, building vast subterranean cities and
complex networks of caves.

Drow have black skin and white hair, and are moderately weaker and have
a more slight constitution than average humans.  Still, like all Elves,
they have a slightly higher dexterity than men.  They are also resistant
to poison.

Members of this race specialize in spell casting, and have thus developed
a very high intelligence.  Being creatures of darkness the Drow tend to
fight more proficiently in the darkness, and have innate infravision with
which to discern objects and living things in the absence of light.

Drow gain 98% of the normal experience award.

Drow can be a Mage, Cleric, Thief, Warrior, Thug, Monk or Diabolist.

Dwarves are relatively short (in Human terms), stocky and powerfully-built
creatures.  Long-lived and extremely sturdy, they are known equally as well
for their hardiness as for their cantankerous personalities.  Their thick,
stout frames give them high strength and stamina, but does not slow them down.
This race has produced some legendary warriors.  Being that they spend most
of their time underground, they have the ability of infravision.

Dwarves average from four foot five inches and five feet tall, with dusky
complexions and thick, fur-covered torsos and limbs.  Both men and women
proudly wear and take pride in their beards.

Dwarves get 96% of the normal experience award.

Dwarves can be a Cleric, Thief, Warrior, Thug, Druid, Ranger or Conjurer.

Tall, slender creatures with an affinity for the woods and nature, Elves
are distant cousins to the Pixies and share the intelligence and dexterity
of that winged race to a lesser degree.  With a lighter frame than Humans,
what they lack in strength and stamina is made up for with their superior
agility - both in thought and movement.  Elves are capable in all classes,
though they function poorest in the role of pure fighter.  Most Elves will
prefer to stay close to nature, and many become druids.  All Elves have
the inherent ability to detect magic, and can resist cold better than most.

The average Elf stands taller than most Humans, being well over six feet.
Most have fair skin and long, straight hair, though there are individual
Elves who chose a darker life reflected in their outward appearance.

Elves only receive 95% of the normal experience award.

Elves can be a Mage, Cleric, Thief, Warrior, Thug, Druid, Ranger, Monk,

Ghouls are the elder race of this world, and the first of the races
to have mastered the skills of magic.  They have a wealth of knowledge
located in their libraries.  Ghouls accidentally let Great Evil Powers into
the realms at one point.  After much battle, they contained these forces
and now keep guard over them, deep under their homecaves.

Ghouls grow to be a bit larger than humans, and have the ability to detect
hidden objects and creatures.  Their strange skin gives them protection
against fire and cold, a useful trait when herding Deep Ones.

Ghouls have access to a lot of knowledge, and therefore need to experience
things a bit more than the other races.  They only receive 80% of the normal
experience point award.

Ghouls can be a Mage, Cleric, Thief, Warrior, Thug, Druid, Ranger, Monk,
Diabolist, Conjurer, Jester or Shaman.

The Gith are a race descended from humans.  Once long ago, they were a
peaceful civilization of humans that were captured by mind flayers and
tormented for centuries.  Eventually, a savior named Gith led them to
freedom, yet their bodies had been flayed by the mental powers of the
illithids.  The Gith found themselves, stronger, quicker, luckier and
smarter than average humans, yet they had lost much of their faith,
wisdom, stamina, and charisma.  They can see the invisible.

They had yellowed skin and were very long of limb.  Sunken eyes peered
from yellowed sockets, now strangely capable of naturally detecting
invisible things.  The Gith race has split into three distinct groups
recently.  The good, the Githzerai, the selfish neutral, the Pirates
of Gith, and the evil, the Githyanki.

Gnomes are a quirky demi-human race.  Though not the mightiest of
races, they resist energy attacks, but are susceptible to fire.
They can see both magical auras and in the infrared spectrum.

Gnomes usually focus in the magical or clerical arts, though a few
rogues have ventured into the arts of thieving (albeit often not
very well.)

Gnomes are a short, stocky race, similar to their dwarven cousins.
Most often prefer an evening at home with a magical tome, a loaf of
pipeweed bread and a cup of ale over venturing out to battle.

Gnomes get 105% of the normal experience award.

Goblins are small, intelligent and quick. Standing only about three feet tall,
they aren't much bigger than a pixie in size, yet are as strong as any human.
Their small stature makes them swift and agile, almost perfect thieves, and
even though they don't look like it, their intelligence is slightly above
average.

Having natural low wisdom, they fail at the clerical arts, making up for it
only by their increased intelligence. The ways of the mage are not out of
reach for a Goblin.

Mostly living in colonies, they dwell deep beneath the earth and due to their
time spent under ground, they have developed the ability to see better than
others in the dark. Working with metal and fire, much like the dwarves, they
have also gained the ability to resist heat better than most, yet lack the
ability to withstand the colder temperatures.

Goblins receive 102% of the normal experience award.

Goblins can be a Mage, Thief, Warrior, Thug, Diabolist, Jester or Shaman.

These beautiful creatures are the result of the mixing of human and Elven
blood.  Though the resulting Half-Elf is not as intelligent as the pure-
blooded Elf, nor as hardy as the full-blooded Human, this mix serves quite
well in a variety of classes which require the standards of both mental
and physical prowess.  Their beautiful almond eyes enable them to discern
objects in the darkness.  They also resist cold like elves do.

Not as tall as the pure Elf, they range from five feet six inches to six
feet five inches, with a heavier musculature than their ancestors.

Half-Elves gain 105% more experience than pure humans do.

The Half-Ogre is a result of breeding during the dark days with humans,
when pure-blooded Ogres were known for raping and looting Human villages.
As a result of this, the Half-Ogre stands from six to nine feet tall in
height and is known for its muscle-packed body that can weigh from three
to four hundred pounds.  Most are relatively hairless, their bodies are
covered with small, boney growths, and their disproportionately long
limbs gives them a somewhat simian appearance.

This offspring of humans and Ogres has inherited great physical abilities:
an aptitude for aggression from its Ogre lineage, inherent infravision to
assist in traversing darkness, and though slightly smaller than pure-bred
Ogres it nevertheless boasts an awesome strength.  Being territorial, most
Half-Ogres will readily engage in battle to establish superiority over any
it encounters.  All in all a race best suited for the role of pure fighter.
Its rough skin resists pointy weapons, much to many a thieves surprise.

Half-Ogres are fairly dim, and only get 90% of the normal experience awards.

Half-Ogres can be a Thief, Warrior, Thug, Druid or Shaman.

A recent mingling of Orcish and Human blood arising as the darker races
have encroached further upon the remaining settled areas, most members
of this half-blooded race are distinctly more Orcish than Human in both
appearance and behavior.  Large and dull of wit, with short but broad
bodies, their poor mental and physical dexterity is offset by an iron
constitution.  Though some have dabbled in the sorcerous arts due to
their human influence, brute combat is is still the natural call which
stirs in the soul of the Half-Orc.  Half-Orcs also seem to have an uncanny
luck about them, which explains a lot of their survival.

Though not as broad nor powerful as full-blood Orcs, Half-Orcs usually
retain their wider bodies, longer, bowed limbs and heavier musculature.
A ridged brow crowned by bushy eyebrows conceals small, squinting eyes;
below a snout-like noses opens a maw filled with crooked fangs; dark
skin emanating a rancid odor; their presence disgusts civilized races.
Standing from five to seven feet tall and averaging two hundred pounds,
an altogether fearsome race.

An intermingling (carried out in the darker lands of the Realms) of the
blood of the Troll with that of Humans, the Half-troll is as deadly as
it is hideous.  Though considerably smaller than full-blood Trolls, the
Half-troll often stands well over eight feet in height and carries over
three hundred pounds on its heavily-muscled frame.  Though naturally of
low wisdom, the race was sorcerously imbued with a wicked intelligence
and the ability to see naturally in the darkness.  Half-trolls usually
make poor pure magic users, and suffer from an unusually low dexterity.
Yet their boundless energy and high intellect create one of the most
cunning physical beasts of the Realms in experienced hands.
While Half-Trolls can't regenerate as their full-blooded parents can, they
are able to reduce the amount of damage done from most weapons naturally.

Owing in part to the black blood which courses through their heavy veins,
the heavily-scaled skin of the Half-troll ranges in color from a charcoal
grey to a deep, blackish green.  Half-trolls revel in the fright of their
appearance, often wearing their hair in battle-braids and emblazoning
themselves with brands and tattoos to accentuate the effect.

Half-Trolls get 90% of the normal experience bonus.

Stout, round, open-minded and very elusive the Hobbit has a level
of dexterity which is only equal to his wit. Many enjoy the thrill of
reading a good book, or telling stories by the fire. Many halflings,
because of this, tend to avoid adventuring, though some rare hobbits
choose the path of the Bard, or storyteller, for their keen intellect
serves them well. This intelligence, coupled by a surprising
determination makes them a curious (though somewhat underpowered)
ally.  They have the abilities of sneak and detect evil.

Halflings have compact bodies and thick, long limbs, and usually have
very hairy feet. Eye color range from blue, brown, green, and any shade
in between.

In the beginning there were Humans, Elves and Ogres. Humans are the most
numerous and the plainest race in the Realms. Although possessing no special
abilities or bonuses, they are the most adaptable and flexible race and are
able to assume any class. Humans are bipedal creatures with two arms
and a roundish head. Their height, weight, eye and hair color vary greatly. It
is rare to find any two who look exactly alike. In dark times Humans and Elves
mated creating a new race, called HALF-ELVES (see help HALF-ELF HALFELF) and
Humans and Ogres mated created the Half-Ogre Race.  (See help HALF-OGRE, or
