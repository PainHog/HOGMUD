Description This beautiful young woman, about five and a half feet in height, stands
dressed in a tight, black gown that sweeps the marble floor as she walks.
Her long, slightly curled black hair falls just below her shoulders, a few
bangs draping over her onyx black eyes.  Thin straps hold her dress on her
petite body, the front showing a decent amount of her milky white skin, the
back dipping down to just above her waist.  On her outstretched hands she
holds a thin silver tray, offering you glasses of an unfamiliar red liquid.  A
small amulet hangs from her neck, a beautiful ruby surrounded by smaller
diamonds attached to a silver chain.  Following the band up the side of her
neck, you see what appears to be two small puncture wounds on the side of her
throat.  Full, pouty lips cover two longer-than-average teeth, which you
notice as she flashes you a mischievous smile, catching your gaze upon her.

Short	Joseph the Tailor~

~
Description When Joseph moved to Alden, the first thing he noticed was that
adventurers tended to wear the same battered and bloody armor to parties and
dinners that they would wear to fight orcs.  He knew that the problem was the
lack of fine outfits, so he opened his own store to serve the needs of the
more refined adventurer.  Joseph mentions to you, "Although everything you see
comes from a basic pattern, talk to an Immortal and they can help you
customize your clothing to fit your own special look."

Short	a Mi-Go~
Long	This crab-like, winged monster jumps around the cavern.
~
Description They were pinkish things about five feet long; with crustaceous bodies bearing
vast pairs of dorsal fins or membraneous wings and several sets of articulated
limbs, and with a sort of convoluted ellipsoid, covered with multitudes of
very short antennae, where a head would ordinarily be.... As it was, nearly
all the rumours had several points in common; averring that the creatures were
a sort of huge, light-red crab with many pairs of legs and with two great
bat-like wings in the middle of their back. They sometimes walked on all their
legs, and sometimes on the hindmost pair only, using the others to convey
large objects of indeterminate nature. On one occasion they were spied in
considerable numbers, a detachment of them wading along a shallow woodland
watercourse three abreast in evidently disciplined formation. Once a specimen
was seen flying -- launching itself from the top of a bald, lonely hill at
night and vanishing in the sky after its great flapping wings had been
silhouetted an instant against the full moon. -- H.P. Lovecraft  "The
Whisperer in Darkness"

Description I think their predominant colour was a greyish-green, though they had white
bellies. They were mostly shiny and slippery, but the ridges of their backs
were scaly. Their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid, while their heads
were the heads of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed. At the
sides of their necks were palpitating gills, and their long paws were webbed.
They hopped irregularly, sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four. I was
somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs. Their croaking, baying
voices, clearly used for articulate speech, held all the dark shades of
expression which their staring faces lacked. -- H.P. Lovecraft  "The Shadow
Over Innsmouth"

Description They were pinkish things about five feet long; with crustaceous bodies bearing

limbs, and with a sort of convoluted ellipsoid, covered with multitudes of
very short antennae, where a head would ordinarily be.... As it was, nearly
all the rumours had several points in common; averring that the creatures were
a sort of huge, light-red crab with many pairs of legs and with two great
bat-like wings in the middle of their back. They sometimes walked on all their
legs, and sometimes on the hindmost pair only, using the others to convey
large objects of indeterminate nature. On one occasion they were spied in
considerable numbers, a detachment of them wading along a shallow woodland
watercourse three abreast in evidently disciplined formation. Once a specimen
was seen flying -- launching itself from the top of a bald, lonely hill at
night and vanishing in the sky after its great flapping wings had been
silhouetted an instant against the full moon. -- H.P. Lovecraft  "The

very short antennae, where a head would ordinarily be.... As it was, nearly

Description I think their predominant colour was a greyish-green, though they had white
bellies. They were mostly shiny and slippery, but the ridges of their backs
were scaly. Their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid, while their heads
were the heads of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed. At the
sides of their necks were palpitating gills, and their long paws were webbed.
They hopped irregularly, sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four. I was
somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs. Their croaking, baying
voices, clearly used for articulate speech, held all the dark shades of
expression which their staring faces lacked. -- H.P. Lovecraft  "The Shadow

train -- a shapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles, faintly self-luminous,
and with myriads of temporary eyes forming and unforming as pustules of
greenish light all over the tunnel-filling front that bore down upon us,
crushing the frantic penguins and slithering over the glistening floor that it
and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter. -- H.P. Lovecraft

Name     Nyarlathotep black man~
Short	Nyarlathotep~
Long	A sinister, black man stands near the strange equipment.
~
Description And it was then that Nyarlathotep came out of Egypt. Who he was, none could
tell, but he was of the old native blood and looked like a Pharaoh. The
fellahin knelt when they saw him, yet could not say why. He said he had risen
up out of the blackness of twenty-seven centuries, and that he had heard
messages from places not on this planet. Into the lands of civilization came
Nyarlathotep, swarthy, slender, and sinister, always buying strange
instruments of glass and metal and combining them into instruments yet
stranger. He spoke much of the sciences -- of electricity and psychology --
and gave exhibitions of power which sent his spectators away speechless, yet
which swelled his fame to exceeding magnitude. Men advised one another to see
Nyarlathotep, and shuddered. And where Nyarlathotep went, rest vanished; for
the small hours were rent with the screams of a nightmare. -- H.P. Lovecraft
"Nyarlathotep"

Description This guard is tired of their job, it is plain to see on their sunken face and

Judging by the double bladed halberd he carries you guess that he is the

and Sahardin you have heard his name half whispered as a man that fights for
the sheer joy of combat and no other reason.  He watches you with a cold eye,
hoping you will become another memory on his blade.

Name     mi-go crab monster~
Short	a Mi-Go~
Long	This crab-like, winged monster jumps around the cavern.
~
Description They were pinkish things about five feet long; with crustaceous bodies bearing
vast pairs of dorsal fins or membraneous wings and several sets of articulated
limbs, and with a sort of convoluted ellipsoid, covered with multitudes of
very short antennae, where a head would ordinarily be.... As it was, nearly
all the rumours had several points in common; averring that the creatures were
a sort of huge, light-red crab with many pairs of legs and with two great
bat-like wings in the middle of their back. They sometimes walked on all their
legs, and sometimes on the hindmost pair only, using the others to convey
large objects of indeterminate nature. On one occasion they were spied in
considerable numbers, a detachment of them wading along a shallow woodland
watercourse three abreast in evidently disciplined formation. Once a specimen
was seen flying -- launching itself from the top of a bald, lonely hill at
night and vanishing in the sky after its great flapping wings had been
silhouetted an instant against the full moon. -- H.P. Lovecraft  "The
Whisperer in Darkness"

Name     deep ones monster creature~
Short	a deep one~
Long	A scaly, half-fish, half-frog creature croaks at you!
~
Description I think their predominant colour was a greyish-green, though they had white
bellies. They were mostly shiny and slippery, but the ridges of their backs
were scaly. Their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid, while their heads
were the heads of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed. At the
sides of their necks were palpitating gills, and their long paws were webbed.
They hopped irregularly, sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four. I was
somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs. Their croaking, baying
voices, clearly used for articulate speech, held all the dark shades of
expression which their staring faces lacked. -- H.P. Lovecraft  "The Shadow
Over Innsmouth"

Short	a Mi-Go~
Long	This crab-like, winged monster jumps around the cavern.
~
Description They were pinkish things about five feet long; with crustaceous bodies bearing
vast pairs of dorsal fins or membraneous wings and several sets of articulated
limbs, and with a sort of convoluted ellipsoid, covered with multitudes of
very short antennae, where a head would ordinarily be.... As it was, nearly
all the rumours had several points in common; averring that the creatures were
a sort of huge, light-red crab with many pairs of legs and with two great
bat-like wings in the middle of their back. They sometimes walked on all their
legs, and sometimes on the hindmost pair only, using the others to convey
large objects of indeterminate nature. On one occasion they were spied in
considerable numbers, a detachment of them wading along a shallow woodland
watercourse three abreast in evidently disciplined formation. Once a specimen
was seen flying -- launching itself from the top of a bald, lonely hill at
night and vanishing in the sky after its great flapping wings had been
silhouetted an instant against the full moon. -- H.P. Lovecraft  "The
Whisperer in Darkness"

Name     deep ones monster creature~
Short	a deep one~
Long	A scaly, half-fish, half-frog creature croaks at you!
~
Description I think their predominant colour was a greyish-green, though they had white
bellies. They were mostly shiny and slippery, but the ridges of their backs
were scaly. Their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid, while their heads
were the heads of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed. At the
sides of their necks were palpitating gills, and their long paws were webbed.
They hopped irregularly, sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four. I was
somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs. Their croaking, baying
voices, clearly used for articulate speech, held all the dark shades of
expression which their staring faces lacked. -- H.P. Lovecraft  "The Shadow
Over Innsmouth"

made no sound, ugly prehensile paws, and barbed tails that lashed needlessly

smiled because they had no faces at all to smile with, but only a suggestive
blankness where a face ought to be. All they ever did was clutch and fly and
tickle; that was the way of night-gaunts.  -- H.P. Lovecraft "The Dream-Quest

Description I think their predominant colour was a greyish-green, though they had white
bellies. They were mostly shiny and slippery, but the ridges of their backs
were scaly. Their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid, while their heads
were the heads of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed. At the
sides of their necks were palpitating gills, and their long paws were webbed.
They hopped irregularly, sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four. I was
somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs. Their croaking, baying
voices, clearly used for articulate speech, held all the dark shades of
expression which their staring faces lacked. -- H.P. Lovecraft  "The Shadow

Short	a Mi-Go~

Description They were pinkish things about five feet long; with crustaceous bodies bearing
vast pairs of dorsal fins or membraneous wings and several sets of articulated
limbs, and with a sort of convoluted ellipsoid, covered with multitudes of
very short antennae, where a head would ordinarily be.... As it was, nearly
all the rumours had several points in common; averring that the creatures were
a sort of huge, light-red crab with many pairs of legs and with two great
bat-like wings in the middle of their back. They sometimes walked on all their
legs, and sometimes on the hindmost pair only, using the others to convey
large objects of indeterminate nature. On one occasion they were spied in
considerable numbers, a detachment of them wading along a shallow woodland
watercourse three abreast in evidently disciplined formation. Once a specimen
was seen flying -- launching itself from the top of a bald, lonely hill at
night and vanishing in the sky after its great flapping wings had been
silhouetted an instant against the full moon. -- H.P. Lovecraft  "The
